  1- The issuer is the actual server that created the token (ValidateIssuer=true) 
  2- The receiver of the token is a valid recipient (ValidateAudience=true) 
  3- The token has not expired (ValidateLifetime=true) ï‚· The signing key is valid and is trusted by the server (ValidateIssuerSigningKey=true)
