- Async programming is a parallel programming technique that allows the working process to run separately from the main application thread.
- If our database requires some time to process the result and return it, the await keyword is going to pause the GetCompanies method execution and return an incomplete task. During that time the tread will be returned to a thread pool making itself available for another request. After the database operation completes the async method will resume executing and will return the list of companies.
- The purpose of Async programming is not to make code faster but to improve efficiency and responsiveness of applications by using resources efficiently.
- It is very important to understand that the Task represents an execution of the asynchronous method and not the result. The Task has several properties that indicate whether the operation was completed successfully or not (Status, IsCompleted, IsCanceled, IsFaulted). With these properties, we can track the flow of our async operations.
- But donâ€™t use the Result property. With this code, we are going to block the thread and potentially cause a deadlock in the application, which is the exact thing we are trying to avoid using the async and await keywords.
