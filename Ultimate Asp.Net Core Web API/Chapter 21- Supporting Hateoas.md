- HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a very important REST constraint. Without it, a REST API cannot be considered RESTful and many of the benefits we get by implementing a REST architecture are unavailable.
- Why we need HATEOAS?
- `API becomes self-discoverable and explorable.` 
- `A client can use the links to implement its logic, it becomes much easier, and any changes that happen in the API structure are directly reflected onto the client.` 
- `The server drives the application state and URL structure and not vice versa.` 
- `The link relations can be used to point to the developerâ€™s documentation.` 
- `Versioning through hyperlinks becomes easier.` 
- `Reduced invalid state transaction calls.` 
- `API is evolvable without breaking all the clients.`
