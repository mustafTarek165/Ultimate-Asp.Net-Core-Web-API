- The Options request can be used to request information on the communication options available upon a certain URI. It allows consumers to determine the options or different requirements associated with a resource. Additionally, it allows us to check the capabilities of a server without forcing action to retrieve a resource.
- Options request just informs client about supported methods for that URL but it doesn't make any restrictions so if client sent request to method not exist in options it will proceed but to actually restrict options we don't implement them in controller and framework handles it if not exist and sends `405 Method Not Allowed`
- The Head is identical to Get but without a response body. This type of request could be used to obtain information about validity, accessibility, and recent modifications of the resource.
