 - Onion architecture is a form of layered architecture and we can visualize these layers as concentric circles.
 - the following approach where we are going to split the architecture into 4 layers: ï‚·
    - Domain Layer 
    - Service Layer 
    - Infrastructure Layer 
    - Presentation Layer
-  Presentation, Infrastructure=> Service=> Domain
- Advantages: Easier testability because everything depends on abstractions. The abstractions can be easily mocked with a mocking library such as Moq.
- We are following the Lazy Instantiation Pattern at creating Services and Repositories here.
